# dAMobileButtonFixer
A small Firefox addon to fix some of the issues with DeviantArt's Notifications area on mobile. By default, DeviantArt's controls for mobile are identical to their desktop controls, making it difficult to click on the buttons unless you zoom way in or use a stylus. This addon increases the size of some buttons to make their target area easier to touch.

## Installation:

Simply visit https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/deviantart-mobile-button-fixer/ and install it in Firefox.
It works best in Firefox for Android, as that is the platform it was designed to help with.
